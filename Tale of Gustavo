Gustavo var samviskulaus leigumorðingi sem fer að efast um lífstíl sinn þegar hann verður ástfanginn. Hann byrjar að plana nýtt líf með henni en áður en hann getur slitið sig frá undirheimunum er kona hans myrt þegar verið er að leita hann uppi. Gustavo hverfur í heim fíkniefna til að forðast raunveruleikann, sjálfan sig og sök hans á morði konunnar sem hann elskaði heitar en allt. Fortíðin kemur á endanum að leita hann uppi og hann endar í fangelsi. Þegar hann losnar þaðan, gamall maður, flýr hann til Parísar og lifir þar huldu höfði til að forðast óvini sína. Með þessu ljóði gerir hann upp líf sitt og játar syndir sínar fyrir ástinni sinni og Guði og er tilbúin til að hitta þau þegar þessu jarðlífi lýkur.

I

I'm ready.
I wrote a synonym
for your beautiful mind
and other stories.

I bought a definition
an old american in paris
my heart a house of cards.

I love you.

I got 'em.
My life
a most violent tv guide
and so the years went.

Worn out
for 5k
hired guns
hired a guy
named Gustavo Fring.

Recognition on a train
and I love her
the sparrow
the mockingbird.

Friends with benefits
fixes you
then follows
the age of Eden.

She's the center
my foundation.

To kill uptown
Oh my goodness
you god eaters
those were the days.

Programming motherfuckers
define driving
me and the electrical engineer 
and the dying girl
with or without you.

Sawzall
and the band played on
mariachi music.

They came together
stepped on a nail
really good stuff.

It works
up to date
man of steel
and then
put their 
option there
back up 
into the woods.

It should have been you
that lived
and the pimp that died.

They might be Spanish giants
or little liars.
Far from the mad crowd
away we go postal
rollin
wanted.

Stay with me
during love and lemons
during ice and fire.

Couple butterfly tattoos.

Of spanish months
voicing the meaning
working out the world.

I was done 
and then she fell.

You said synonyms
sure thing
made in america
and gave'em meaning.

a rod
a key 
a food

And justice got'em
them joining them
a thousand years.

I'm not Gustavo Cerati
I was spanish.

An act of god
illegal fireworks
immigrant microwing 
corn on the cob.

He man
took the Spanish
to the gallows
on money order.

I need your love
you gave me
and the mountains echoed
he got game.

Ella fue.

And we danced
by the trailer
like strippers 
at funerals in China.

And I loved her
an American in Paris
every witch way.

Once upon a time
in a place named desire
while we were young
a vulture with my crooked woes
I'd love to change the world.

Go find me
it gets harsher.

The strain of knowing yourself
while waiting for godot
mountains beyond mountains.

I'm on the chopping block.

Flash!

Wood kingdom
falling skies
asleep at the wheel

to whom it may concern
the weather channel
tv listings

snow white
making love
at ground zero

beef wellington
turns to tacos

Monsters gear.

a raisin in the sun
is a pot bellied pig
stove top grill

eating from the source

a disorder world
styrofoam balls
cup of jo

my company is
for sale by owner.

II
Never let you go.
I show up dead
walking in the woods
of history.

Looking in windows
rifles for sale
looking at home
ammo to go.

The night lasts long
the museum of day.
Everything's an argument
and closed ends.

My wet seal boots
my winter pal
a soldier of envy.

They came together 
millers of the night
asking about the giants
about me and the dying girl.

I said I'm ready
cause and effect
fuck the police
I have no fear.

Estaba cansado.

We who laughed until we cried
loved until we cried.

redneck jokes
backpage queens
highway to hell
in a cop car.

was this real
drunk in love

the gallows
night sweats
jailhouse 
my collect call
got hung up.

Justice for all.
He knows my name,
Gustavo.

Ugly coyote on a
tijuana picnic

Missed connections
missed family
why did you die?

I miss you
I am a loss.

My pillow
uneasy jazz.

I want you to know
up in the air
I'm an american in Paris
my name is now Jeff.

Was this inevitable
this picking ache?
What's the meaning
of me left busted behind?

Why not me before you?
Deamons on front row 
walking on glass floors.

The sinkhole
in the backyard 
of the broken masters
a imitation of 
a leaking toilet.

Was I Robin Hood?
Was I real?

What's my syndrome?

We were going 
on a trip
to Paris.

I look down 
on my trembling hands
up on the roof.
I survived
now you see me.
